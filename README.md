# PCBuilder
Cross platform java app which loads in and displays premade pc config profiles, from either a downloaded zip file or a url which points to a zip file download

The config profiles have to be made manually, following the structure found here inside the Resources folder. (there are some example profiles in that folder)

This is just a project I made for fun, because I wanted to help my friend build a PC and I thought why not make an app for it.

In the future I might make a profile creator inside the app if I have the time and mood for it

#### Requirements: Java (version 8 and up)
#### Tested with: Java 8 and 10 on Windows & MacOS
